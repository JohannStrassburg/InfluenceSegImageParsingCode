% demo SIFT+visual words using LabelMe toolbox
clear all

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% SIFT parameters:
VWparam.imagesize = 256; % normalized image size (images will be scaled so that the maximal axis has this dimension before computing the sift features)
VWparam.grid_spacing = 1; % distance between grid centers
VWparam.patch_size = 16; % size of patch from which to compute SIFT descriptor (it has to be a factor of 4)
VWparam.NumVisualWords = 200; % number of visual words
VWparam.Mw = 2; % number of spatial scales for spatial pyramid histogram
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% CONSTANTS (you can not change this)
w = VWparam.patch_size/2; % boundary 

% read database struct
HOMEIMAGES = 'C:\atb\Databases\sceneCategories\images'
HOMEANNOTATIONS = 'C:\atb\Databases\sceneCategories\annotations'
D = LMdatabase(HOMEANNOTATIONS, HOMEIMAGES);

% Build dictionary of visual words
VWparam = LMkmeansVisualWords(D, VWparam, HOMEIMAGES);

% COMPUTE VISUAL WORDS: 
[VW, sptHist] = LMdenseVisualWords(D(1:10), HOMEIMAGES, VWparam);
