Code for boosted decision trees or boosted 1D kernel density estimates
using Adaboost.L algorithm of

M. Collins, R. Schapire, and Y. Singer. Logistic regression, Adaboost, 
and Bregman distances.  Machine Learning, 48(1-3), 2002.

train_boosted_dt_mc.m - train boosted decision trees (> 2 classes, 1 vs. all)
train_boosted_dt_2c.m - train boosted decision trees (2 classes)
test_boosted_dt_mc.m - evaluate features with bdt classfier (works for 2c also)
 
Note: haven't used these in a while or documented lately
train_boosted_kde_2c.m - train boosted kernel density estimates (2 classes)
test_boosted_kde_2c.m - test boosted kernel density estimtes (2 classes)


Use freely at your own risk.

You may need to recompile treevalc.c (mcc -m treevalc.c) to use test_boosted_dt_mc.  Alternatively, comment out the treevalc line and uncomment the treeval line of test_boosted_dt_mc to run matlab version (slower).
